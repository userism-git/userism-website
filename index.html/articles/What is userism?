<h1>What is userism?</h1>
<h3>Userist Collective • December 2, 2025</h3>
<p>A brief explanation.
<br>The rise of digital automation is changing the structure of social conflict. As machines and digital systems increasingly take over both physical and cognitive labor, work becomes less central to how power is organized. 
<br>This isn’t a new observation, we already know that automation shifts value creation away from traditional labor, but it’s worth saying it again, because the consequences are becoming clearer.
<br><br>What becomes central is the role of users. Digital systems depend on users for both intention and value. 
<br>As we wrote in 2024: “We are the consumers; we define the value of the economy.” Our choices and desires continuously redirect productive flows, and the more automated machine labor becomes, the more this user-based power grows.
<br><br>Yet this power comes with a new conflict. Users are not only active agents; they are also involuntary contributors, feeding the digital machine through data. 
<br>This creates tension between users’ freedom to shape value flows and the interests of organized powers such  as states or companies, that seek to guide, influence, or monitor them. Some influence is probably inevitable. But if these powers reflect a collective user will, formed through democratic, user-organized structures, automation can genuinely become a liberating force rather than a threat.
<br><br>This is what Userism aims to address.
<br>Userism defends the collective interests of users within emerging digital power dynamics. It is both an analytical framework and a practical approach. 
<br>When users articulate their interests clearly and organize their power, the optimistic outcomes often associated with automation become realistic. For that to happen, we must move beyond fear of “the end of work” and see it with a positive, confident, and assertive vision.
<br><br>The struggle ahead should remain peaceful, rooted in discourse, civic organization, and non-violent means. The digital era already offers the tools for this. Userism simply proposes that we use them collectively, intentionally, and in service of users themselves.
