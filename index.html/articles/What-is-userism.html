        <h1>What is userism?</h1>
        <p class="byline">Userist Collective • December 2, 2025</p>

        <p>A brief explanation.</p>
        
        <p>The rise of digital automation is changing the structure of social conflict. As machines and digital systems increasingly take over both physical and cognitive labor, work becomes less central to how power is organized.</p>

        <p>This isn’t a new observation; we already know that automation shifts value creation away from traditional labor, but it’s worth saying it again, because the consequences are becoming clearer.</p>

        <p>What becomes central is the role of users. Digital systems depend on users for both intention and value. As we wrote in 2024: <strong>“We are the consumers; we define the value of the economy.”</strong> Our choices and desires continuously redirect productive flows, and the more automated machine labor becomes, the more this user-based power grows.</p>

        <p>Yet this power comes with a new conflict. Users are not only active agents; they are also involuntary contributors, feeding the digital machine through data. This creates tension between users’ freedom to shape value flows and the interests of organized powers such as states or companies, that seek to guide, influence, or monitor them.</p>

        <p>This is what Userism aims to address. Userism defends the collective interests of users within emerging digital power dynamics. It is both an analytical framework and a practical approach.</p>

        <p>The struggle ahead should remain peaceful, rooted in discourse, civic organization, and non-violent means. Userism simply proposes that we use the tools of the digital era collectively, intentionally, and in service of users themselves.</p>
