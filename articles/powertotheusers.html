                <p class="intro">Between robots, artificial intelligence, and smartphones, we often ask ourselves: where are we headed, and what will become of us? The answer is simple: we will all become users, work will matter less and less, and we will have to contend with those who control the flow of our data. These are the consequences of digitalization—both artificial and natural, and unstoppable. The key is to make it a positive experience for everyone, rather than a lever of power for a few. To that end, this article introduces the concept of userism, a new term describing digital users as the true economic engine of technological societies. But before turning to neologisms, we begin with real stories. We will discuss labor, how digitalization is transforming the world, and the rise of technological societies. Userism comes at the end.

<h3>The Neolithic Ends in Iowa</h3>
It is a normal working day for David Miller, an ideal-typical farmer from Iowa. It is 2026, and he is one of many farmers in his state. He works with a couple of colleagues on a medium-sized field. The weather is good today, and David begins by checking on his phone which parts of the land have been sown, irrigated, fertilized, what inputs were used, and so on. The systems confirm that it is time to harvest part of the crop, so he and his colleagues climb into their agricultural vehicles. With the combine harvester, they follow invisible but precise lines thanks to the satellite and digital systems integrated into the vehicle. Their coordination is impeccable.
<br>Corn is typically grown in Iowa—it is a tradition—but David is diversifying his production to meet foreign demand for soybeans. Yet he does not need to overhaul his means of production: the software he uses adapts to each decision, helping him understand how to operate machinery for the new crops.
<br>After the workday, David is tired but proud. In a single day he has fed hundreds of people, at home and abroad. It is thanks to people like him that the United States of America is today the world’s third-largest agricultural producer and leading exporter. And yet the entire U.S. primary sector employs just 1.6% of the workforce—one person out of sixty. A completely inverted ratio compared to that of our ancestors, who from the Neolithic onward lived primarily by cultivating the land, feeding themselves and sustaining a narrow elite of non-farmers. In their eyes, someone like David Miller might seem like a saint, descended to earth to free arms from the fields and heads from the sun, allowing everyone to eat without having to toil.

<h3>Robots Threaten Zhengzhou</h3>
On the other side of the world, vast Chinese factories work tirelessly, feeding the world not with food but with products of every kind: smartphones, cars, sneakers. Zhang Jing, an ideal-typical Chinese worker, has lived in Zhengzhou for several years. Every day she goes to Foxconn, to a plant where most iPhones are assembled.
<br>Her job is still labor-intensive, because Apple does not fully trust machines for this delicate stage. Human workers are more precise. As a result, an assembly line like the one where Zhang Jing works includes more than a thousand people. The Zhengzhou plant has nearly a hundred such lines operating in parallel.
<br>Talking with colleagues, Jing learns that Foxconn’s upper management is testing robots with the intention of halving the number of employees required per line. After all, assembling a typical Android phone requires only a few dozen workers. If robots could guarantee Apple-level quality, cutting jobs would seem reasonable. In fact, Apple has explicitly requested greater automation after protests and violent clashes between workers and police demonstrated how a massive workforce can become a major liability.
<br>When Zhang Jing returns home, she is worried. If she loses her job to robots, she is unsure what she could do instead. As she falls asleep, she imagines working in delivery services—running between minimarket shelves, directed by an app, on her feet all day. It would not be an improvement.

<h3>The Flight of Labor</h3>
It is easy to empathize with Zhang Jing. In the West, millions of secondary-sector jobs disappeared within a few decades. We understand instinctively what a sudden employment cut can mean. We are familiar with the great eastward flight of manual labor, escaping from the organized and well-paid working masses of the West.
<br>In hindsight, we see that this flight weakened Western labor, plunging the left into chronic crisis and allowing elites to dismantle labor protections and public services beginning in the 1980s. Much of that labor found refuge in China, which today has an industrial output greater than that of the United States of America, Germany, Japan, and India combined.
<br>Yet something extraordinary is happening: in China, labor has not found a home, but something more like a hospital bed to prolong its life. Although China’s secondary sector has grown at around 5% annually, employment in it has risen only 4.7% in absolute terms over ten years—and in the past five years it has even declined. Not because production is fleeing to states like India or Vietnam, but because China is robotizing at a pace that allows output to grow while reducing necessary labor.
<br>Today about 32% of Chinese workers are employed in the secondary sector, but that percentage may never reach the levels typical of early industrialized countries (in Germany, manual workers were 34% of the workforce until 2000, and 51% in 1970). In automation, however, the trend is clear. In 2018 China ranked nineteenth worldwide in industrial robot density. Within five years it climbed sixteen positions to third, behind only South Korea and Singapore.
<br>One day, like David Miller, workers such as Zhang Jing may form a small minority. It may take time before the figure drops to the fateful 1.6% seen in U.S. agriculture, but the trend and the technologies are paving the way toward this new normal.

<h3>Technological Societies</h3>
From the stories of David Miller and Zhang Jing we glimpse our future: neither agriculture nor industry is central anymore in shaping the structure of future societies. With due respect to Mao Zedong and Karl Marx, the era of communist revolutions led by workers and peasants appears to have ended. The solidarity once generated by shared workplaces and conditions does not replicate in the tertiary sector—services—characterized by increasing complexity and fragmentation of tasks. On such foundations, it is difficult to build a collective movement with clear direction.
<br>Digitalization, by contrast, appears to be the most shared and systematic experience of life in the new millennium. Its disruptive force steadily replaces traditional physical modes of economic interaction, establishing digital systems as the new spaces of production and consumption. The growing, pervasive, mass presence of the digital distinguishes past agricultural and industrial societies from what we might simply call “technological societies.”
<br>There are two reasons why digitalization is experienced similarly by individuals and collectivities in technological societies. First, the underlying tendency appears universal: through the digital gesture, each human seeks a secure and personal dimension for consumption, work, and social relations, free from material constraints. This reflects the species’ desire to inhabit an increasingly abstract realm, where thought—free in imagination—dominates matter, where humans are bound by physical limits. The digital gesture (most commonly, using a smartphone) is thus as natural as if inscribed in our genes.
<br>Second, in technological societies every user, regardless of job or social role, becomes an involuntary source of data. Data means behavioral, emotional, or intellectual analyses of individuals and collectivities. These analyses are cumulative and replicable, exploiting the abstract nature of the digital realm, where every interaction is fully catalogable. Extracting the largest possible quantity of data means gaining progressively deeper knowledge of societies and individuals. In an increasingly abstract and human-centered world, such knowledge is the true dividing line between power—economic or social—and subordination.

<h3>Power to the Users!</h3>
Technological societies stand on a more efficient and convenient economic system than any before, characterized by:
    <br>1. Growing importance of users, who inhabit digital space and generate both demand for goods and services and the data used to create and improve supply;
   <br> 2. Decreasing need for human workers to produce and distribute goods and services, increasing time available for digital consumption;
    <br>3. The rise of companies or governments able to obtain or impose control over digital capital—that is, data and the technologies to extract it.
<br>Faced with these transformations, disorientation is natural among those unable to interpret them and forced to endure their consequences: ordinary people, but also many governments and firms. Reactions range from resignation to skepticism, niche counter-power efforts, or regulatory attempts to contain digital intrusion. At the same time, those who ride the change display fierce determination. Many states and corporations act without scruple to capture the profit and power derived from new technologies, generating both indignation and admiration among users—yet never truly involving them.
<br>This discrepancy has allowed elites to retain most benefits of digitalization. Technological societies are experiencing growing inequality and divergence between technological elites and the broader population.
<br>For the minimal advantage gained by an ordinary person from a digital service, the company providing it can gain far more by aggregating vast numbers of users—the true wealth behind its data. While users have benefited from instant communication and sharing systems, such as social media, the companies that created these services are far more powerful than the user masses who generated their value. They influence political and economic power through platform-generated profit far more than users are enriched in return. Yet it is precisely users who make these platforms exist and matter.
<br>For this reason, to correct the economic and social distortions of digitalization, I propose starting from users themselves. Recognizing them as the true core of emerging wealth in technological societies points toward emancipation. The goal is to move from unconscious abstraction and passive data extraction to collective awareness, where users recognize themselves as the fundamental force—more than any single government or corporation—deserving the benefits derived from their own data. This idea as a whole is what I call “userism.”
<br>In light of the three characteristics of technological societies—(1) growing importance of users; (2) declining labor; (3) rising technological elites—the goal of userism is not to patch over the data and labor gap with rules, limits, or taxes. Such mechanisms, though noble and partially useful, can only temporarily contain digitalization’s powerful current. Userism instead sees the emergence of a world of users as an opportunity. These rivers of data can be used, not merely endured, by building channels that irrigate the economy and society equitably for the benefit of all. For this to happen, however, the source of the current—the collective body of users—must determine its scope and direction.
<br>It is not an individual struggle of a user fighting for privacy, nor of a worker fearing robots. These reactions are legitimate responses to a digitalization monopolized by elites. But if the technological people themselves appropriated the transformation, privacy would become a natural fact, data usage a public good, and robotics a liberation.
<br>Imagine the collective well-being that could emerge if Amazon’s algorithms were used to distribute goods efficiently worldwide without translating into dividends and hyper-consumption; if the deep knowledge of human behavior possessed by Google or OpenAI were used solely to improve services and well-being; if the medical, productive, and managerial capacities of these systems were deployed for the benefit of all rather than the profit of a few.
<br>According to userism, this is possible and not utopian, because user power rests on two simple truths: (1) users provide the information necessary to generate data; (2) users, as digital consumers, determine the value and meaning of every service. Therefore collectively, across various forms and scales, users possess enormous bargaining power that can shape ownership of digital capital itself. What they need is just imagination—to devise the systems through which to assert that power.
