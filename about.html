<h1>About us</h1>
   <p>We are the Userist Collective—just two people who met in Shanghai and started thinking together about the world’s economy. 
     <br><br>We believe that today it is not so much work, but consumption, that creates social wealth—and that struggle over that wealth is where the real conflict lies. We also believe that this change is only possible through the digital world, which is why we see users as a powerful, though for now fragmented, community. 
     <br><br>Our work and research aim to explore the potential of users, how they could organize to resist digital authoritarianism, and how they could take ownership of the future on behalf of the people. It is a big, difficult task—but we are confident it is the right one. 
     <br><br>We move forward without nostalgia for a past that is gone, and without fear of a technology that, if guided by the people, could deliver the most human century the world has ever seen.
   <br><br>This is an open collective. Anyone can join. Just contact us, and together we will discuss our ideas, see if there is alignment, and welcome different contributions.</p>
